Are you in the market for a new buggy? There are a few things to consider before making your purchase. First, think about your lifestyle and where you will be using the buggy. Will you be using it mostly on paved sidewalks or on rough terrain? This will determine the type of wheels and suspension you need.

Next, consider the size and weight of the buggy. If you plan on traveling frequently or using public transportation, a lightweight and compact buggy may be more practical. However, if you have a larger car or plan on using the buggy for outdoor activities, a larger and sturdier model may be necessary.

Lastly, don't forget about safety features such as a five-point harness and adjustable handlebars. It's also important to read reviews and do research on the brand and model you are considering. By taking these factors into account, you can make an informed decision and find the perfect buggy for your needs.
